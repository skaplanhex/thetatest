<p>The table below summarises the impact of an nuisance parameter on the rate prediction of a process.</p>
    <p>For a nuisance parameter, (gauss) indicates that this nuisance parameter has a gaussian prior, (gamma) that it has a gamma prior.</p>
    <p>For the individual cells, (r) indicates the 'rate only' part of the uncertainty, (s) indicates the effect on the rate of an uncertainty
    treated via template morphing (i.e., the <em>rate</em> effect of an uncertainty treated as part of the
    template morphing; even if this is zero, the shape effect is still taken into account). Note that both effects are applied seperatly, so
    the total rate change is about the linear sum of these two.<br/>
    The rate change in 'plus' direction of the uncertainty is written as superscript,
    the 'minus' direction as subscript.<br/>All numbers are in percent.</p>
